# Display Emoji Based on Face Expression 😊#
This project is a Python-based application that detects facial expressions in real time and displays corresponding emojis based on the identified emotion. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection and an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for expression recognition.

🚀 Features
Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade.

Expression classification using SVM.

Displays relevant emoji based on detected emotion.

Simple and user-friendly interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV – for image processing and face detection.

Haar Cascade Classifier – for real-time face detection.

Scikit-learn (SVM Classifier) – for training and predicting facial expressions.

Tkinter / OpenCV GUI (optional) – for visual display.
