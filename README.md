# Display Emoji Based on Face Expression 😊
This is a Python-based project that detects facial expressions in real-time and displays the corresponding emoji 😁 based on the identified emotion!
It uses 👀 Haar Cascade Classifiers for face detection and an 🤖 SVM (Support Vector Machine) for emotion recognition.


🚀 Features

✨ Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade

🧠 Expression classification using SVM

😊 Displays relevant emoji based on detected emotions

🖥️ Simple & user-friendly interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📸 OpenCV – for image processing and face detection

🔍 Haar Cascade Classifier – for detecting faces in real time

🧪 Scikit-learn (SVM) – for training and predicting expressions

🪟 Tkinter/OpenCV GUI – for displaying the results with emojis

🧠 How It Works 🧩

👤 Face Detection:
OpenCV’s Haar Cascade is used to detect the face from the camera input.

📊 Expression Classification:
The face is passed to a trained SVM model which identifies the emotion — like 😊 Happy, 😠 Angry, 😢 Sad, 😮 Surprised.

😂 Emoji Display:
An emoji matching the detected expression is displayed on the screen in real time!

🧰 Getting Started

📦 Prerequisites
